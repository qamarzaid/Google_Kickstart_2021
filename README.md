### Problem: K-Goodness String
```
Charles defines the goodness score of a string as the number of indices i such that Si≠SN−i+1 where 1≤i≤N/2 (1-indexed). 
For example, the string CABABC has a goodness score of 2 since S2≠S5 and S3≠S4.

Charles gave Ada a string S of length N, consisting of uppercase letters and asked her to convert it into a string with 
a goodness score of K. In one operation, Ada can change any character in the string to any uppercase letter. Could you 
help Ada find the minimum number of operations required to transform the given string into a string with goodness score equal to K?
